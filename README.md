# CircleGenerationApproximation
A demo of an approximation function being more accurate than the real floating point implementation.

This code shows a higher precision approximate function out performing a lower precision precise function. This is interesting because the approximate function is upto 10x faster on modern machines.

We want to use this as an argument for gaining performance in real-time and high performing application through approximation.
